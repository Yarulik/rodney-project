## Access images from the Raspberry Pi Camera
As stated in part 1 we can make use of work already carried out by the ROS community to make our life easier. The Raspberry Pi Ubuntu image I have installed includes a ROS package raspicam_node, we will make use of this package to access the camera. If you are using a different OS image on your Raspberry Pi you can still install the node from the GitHub site.
